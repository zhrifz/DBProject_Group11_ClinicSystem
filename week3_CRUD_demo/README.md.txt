Week 3 – Basic CRUD Implementation

This week, we completed the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) module for the Patient entity in our Clinic Appointment System project.

Completed
Patient CRUD
- list.php — Display all patient records
- add.php — Add new patient (includes auto age calculation from date of birth)
- edit.php — Update patient info (auto age recalculation)
- delete.php — Delete patient record

In Progress
Doctor Module
- CRUD doctor will be implemented by teammate

Appointment Module
- Appointment CRUD will be implemented after doctor and patient modules are fully ready.

Notes
- Files here only include the main CRUD logic as required for Week 3.
- Actual running system is in the prototype folder (not included here).
